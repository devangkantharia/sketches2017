This is a repository that stores Processing sketches I created while commuting every day.
You can see GIFs of these sketches from [here](http://radiumsoftware.tumblr.com/tagged/processing).

I'm using [GPD Win](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/gpd-win-intel-z8700-win-10-os-game-console-laptop/)
handheld PC for sketching. I think this is the best portable development environment -- I created all these
sketches while standing in a train.
